I am Aseem Deodhar. I work as a Research Analyst with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council - [MAPC](https://www.mapc.org/).

I recently completed my Master of Science in Urban Informatics from Northeastern University under [Dr. Dan Oâ€™Brien](<https://cssh.northeastern.edu/people/faculty/daniel-t-obrien/>). I feel very honored to have been awarded the [Graduate Student Leadership Award](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/policyschool/2020/04/end-of-year-awards-2020/) upon graduating. 

I am experienced in, and passionate about civic technology and its applications in transportation, urban & regional planning, and policy development. Here, you can see these interests combine and display themselves through academic, professional, as well as personal projects. I am always looking for advice on, and to collaborate with others on my personal research projects.

I built this website using the ```{blogdown}``` package with Rmarkdown. [You can do it too](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)!
