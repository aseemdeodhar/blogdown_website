<p><strong>Upgradation and Redevelopment of A Historic Economic Centre</strong></p>
<p>Krishna Rajendra Market | Jana USP | 2017 - present</p>
<p>KR (Krishna Rajendra) Market in Bangalore is a historic public market dating back to the early 1920s. Since then it has transformed from a small neighborhood market to the largest supplier of fruits, vegetables, meat, and other sundry items to Bangalore; a city of 11 million people and growing. Although KR Market is the largest market in the city in terms of volume and value of commodities exchanged, it faces a number of issues that deter it from living up to its full potential. Today it is noted as a major flower market as well as an iconic Bangalorean institution.</p>
