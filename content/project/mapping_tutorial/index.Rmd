## Spatial Analysis and Mapping in R using the {sf} and {ggplot2} packages

On March 17th of 2021, I had the opportunity to introduce the concepts of spatial analysis and mapping in R to the Big Data for Cities class at Northeastern University - the same class where I had initially learned all of this in the Fall of 2018.

I gave a brief overview of the basic components of a spatial data file, and how to use the {sf} and {ggplot2} packages to map the contents of a spatial data file, as well as some popularly used functions to manipulate spatial objects.

In addition to the technical introduction, I spoke about the various kinds of administrative geographies in the United States - political and census geographies.

### Code and Files

You can download the code and data files used to plot the map above [from this link](https://github.com/aseemdeodhar/r_mapping) and try to map, and manipulate it. I'd love to see what maps you make!
