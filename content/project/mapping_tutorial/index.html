<h2>Spatial Analysis and Mapping in R using the {sf} and {ggplot2} packages</h2>
<p>On March 17th of 2021, I had the opportunity to introduce the concepts of spatial analysis and mapping in R to the Big Data for Cities class at Northeastern University - the same class where I had initially learned all of this in the Fall of 2018.</p>
<p>I gave a brief overview of the basic components of a spatial data file, and how to use the {sf} and {ggplot2} packages to map the contents of a spatial data file, as well as some popularly used functions to manipulate spatial objects.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical introduction, I spoke about the various kinds of administrative geographies in the United States - political and census geographies.</p>

<h3>Code and Files</h3>
<p>You can download the code and data files used to plot the map above <a href="https://github.com/aseemdeodhar/r_mapping">from this link</a> and try to map, and manipulate it. Iâ€™d love to see what maps you make!</p>
