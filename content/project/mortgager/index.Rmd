# {mortgager}

This package was developed to calculate homeownership costs for MassHousing's [Commonwealth Builder Program](https://www.masshousing.com/en/developers/commonwealth-builder). This package was used to analyse a proprietary dataset of home sale records from 2010 to 2020 in Massachusetts to determine the affordability of existing and historic sales.

## Formula

The formula used for calculating monthly home-ownership payment amounts is based on a widely accepted monthly mortgage formula, which here is adapted from that seen on the [Nerdwallet website](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator/calculate-mortgage-payment).


![](/img/project/mortgager/formula.png)

**Where:**

* **M** = Monthly mortgage amount
* **P** = Principal amount, ie total loan amount
* **i** = Monthly mortgage interest rate
* **n** = Number of payments across loan duration. (This is generally assumed to be number of months. For example, a loan with a payback period of 30 years, will have 360 payments in total)

In addition to the monthly mortgage payment, there are other costs associated with home-ownership which are then added to calculate total home-ownership costs, namely:


* **PMI factor** – only for loans with a downpayment less than 20%, assumed at 7.5% annually on the mortgage amount
* **Home-owners** insurance – assumed at $1000 annually
* **Condo fees** – applicable only to condominium sales, assumed at $1000 annually
* **Property Tax** - an annual percentage amount taxed on assessed property value dependent on the jurisdiction the unit is located in.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mortgager with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("aseemdeodhar/mortgager")
```

## {mortgager}

Load the \code{mortgager} package with this line:

```{r example}
library(mortgager)
```

## Examples for each function:

### mortgager::monthlypayment()

\code{monthlypayment} calculates monthly home-ownership costs based on tax rates, interest rates, downpayment rate, and home cost price.

```{r}
monthlypayment(mortgage_rate = 3,
               property_tax = 12,
               downpayment_rate = .2,
               home_price = 450000)
```

### mortgager::max_homeprice()

\code{max_homeprice} calculates maximum affordable home price based on annual income with a set monthly housing cost percentage (default is 30%).

```{r}
max_homeprice(annualinc = c(61000, 75000, 22330, 120000),
              mortgage_rate = 2.7,
              property_tax = 6)
```

### mortgager::downpayment_amt()

\code{downpayment_amt} calculates the total downpayment amount based on sale price and downpayment rate

```{r}
downpayment_amt(home_price = 250000,
                downpayment_rate = 0.10)
```

### mortgager::reqd_income()

\code{reqd_income} calculates the minimum annual income required for total housing costs to remain at or below a set proportion of household income.

```{r}
reqd_income(monthlypayment = 2000,
            housing_cost_rate = 0.30)
```
