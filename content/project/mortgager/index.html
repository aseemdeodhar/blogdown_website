<h1>{mortgager}</h1>
<p>This package was developed to calculate homeownership costs for MassHousing’s <a href="https://www.masshousing.com/en/developers/commonwealth-builder">Commonwealth Builder Program</a>. This package was used to analyse a proprietary dataset of home sale records from 2010 to 2020 in Massachusetts to determine the affordability of existing and historic sales.</p>
<div id="formula" class="section level2">
<h2>Formula</h2>
<p>The formula used for calculating monthly home-ownership payment amounts is based on a widely accepted monthly mortgage formula, which here is adapted from that seen on the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator/calculate-mortgage-payment">Nerdwallet website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/project/mortgager/formula.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong> = Monthly mortgage amount</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> = Principal amount, ie total loan amount</li>
<li><strong>i</strong> = Monthly mortgage interest rate</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> = Number of payments across loan duration. (This is generally assumed to be number of months. For example, a loan with a payback period of 30 years, will have 360 payments in total)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the monthly mortgage payment, there are other costs associated with home-ownership which are then added to calculate total home-ownership costs, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PMI factor</strong> – only for loans with a downpayment less than 20%, assumed at 7.5% annually on the mortgage amount</li>
<li><strong>Home-owners</strong> insurance – assumed at $1000 annually</li>
<li><strong>Condo fees</strong> – applicable only to condominium sales, assumed at $1000 annually</li>
<li><strong>Property Tax</strong> - an annual percentage amount taxed on assessed property value dependent on the jurisdiction the unit is located in.</li>
</ul>
